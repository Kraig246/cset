- I think that it's important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned by one person or company because
since HTML is standard for the backbone of all websites, a massive change to the language could be detrimental to most websites if changed. Since it's controlled
by a specification, this means that HTML is a lot more concrete than it is abstract, making it much easier for newer coders to learn.
- The difference between an *element* and a *tag* is that an element is a set of opening and closing tags, like <h1></h1>. However, tags only end with a > symbol
and not the traditional </> that is typically seen in elements. There is a visual difference, as <!DOCTYPE> is a tag since there is no </!DOCTYPE> included into the document.
- In the lecture, the following quote from the notorious Star Wars character Yoda: "The greatest teacher, failure is." as a reference to explain that even though the way that Yoda
speaks doesn't conform to the traditional syntax rules of the English language that we are used to, we can still understand him because he still follows the correct semantics. Unlike us, computers can't understand commands unless
it is given to them through the rules of programming language syntax or semantics. Therefore, we are smarter than computers according to this logic. Meanwhile, the quote "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"
by Noam Chomsky is given to us as a representation of something that follows the correct semantics of the English language, but is still confusing. This would be correct syntactically because it follows all of the
rules of the English language, but we can't understand what it means because of the quote's fortune cookie-like semantics.
