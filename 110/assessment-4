- In terms of building other platform specific user interfaces, I learned that I have to look out for things like retina display as well as mobile or low resolution screens. When building these platform specific user interfaces, I learned that I have to design media queries and my CSS elements according to these possible non-standard conditions in order to create an effective responsive design.
- Two examples of CSS media queries that use different media featues are @media and @import. @media is used for applying part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more media queries, while @import imports rules from other CSS stylesheets. Functionally, these are very different from one-another. A user agent will decide to use these rulesets depending on what they need to use these two attributes for. If a user agent has to import styles from another stylesheet, they will use @import, but if they need to create a general media query, they are going to use @media.
- I think that it is better to define breakpoints using the specific content on your site according to standard device sizes because one style of media query won't work for all websites, but at the same time, you want it to conform to standard device sizes. If your media query is tuned to your content but not to standard device sizes, your site may look good but it will have issues on mobile platforms and low resolution PC screens. At the same time, if your media query is tuned only to standard device sizes and not adjusted to your content, your website will look weird no matter what to anyone who isn't using the website in full screen. Because of this, I think that there has to be a balance between defining breakpoints between standard device sizes as well as the specific content on your website.
