* After two weeks in this program, I feel like my biggest challenge will be getting used to JavaScript. In high school, I learned JavaScript briefly and we didn't
really go over too much. I'm eager to learn as much as I can, and to overcome this aforementioned challenge, I will pay attention in class, attend tutoring as needed,
and learn using outside resources if I have to. I'm excited to learn JavaScript because it's something that's still somewhat new to me, and I'm eager to learn anything
that will make me successful and more marketable as a software engineer.
*In JavaScript, the difference between *while*, *do...while* and *for* loops is that *while* loops are for testing a condition before the loop's first iteration,
do...while* loops are used for testing for conditions that are found after the loop's first iteration, and *for* loops are loops that consist of optional expressions that
are followed by a statement.
*The process of writing in pseudocode and then translating the solution into JavaScript is important because mapping out your ideas in pesudocode or English gives your brain
an idea of how your coding process is going to work before you go to write your code. Personally, in coding, mapping out my ideas either by sketching what my outcome will look
like in web design or writing pseudocode to get an idea of what I should be doing in Javascript is far easier than simply freestyling with code; going into my project without a solid
outlook on what my final product should look like. In future classes, this will help me because when I learn in-depth JavaScript or other coding languages, I am going to find pseudocode
extremely useful for the reasons I have stated previously.
