- In this Computer Software Engineering Technology program, I'm not sure how to feel about the pace. Part of me feels like it's just right, but at the same time I also feel like it's a bit too fast. I still feel quite iffy
about coding with JavaScript because I've always had trouble with an online learning format, but I sure think that it's fun. The project sure seems like a lot of fun and is very interesting, and I'm going to most likely visit tutoring,
codeacademy or other learning services in order to sharpen my skills with coding in JS because I don't feel like I have everything down just yet. I like what we're doing, and I want to be as good as I can be at it.

- I think that functions are a useful tool to organize large programs because they can be used to perform specific tasks. These specific tasks can be named, meaning
it's easier for the coder to organize since they can create function names that are closer to human language than vanilla JS.

- In JavaScript, there are two types of scopes. Local scopes, and Global scopes. Local scopes have Function scopes, meaning they can only be accessed from the inside of a function.
Global scopes ensure that all scripts and functions can access it. In a zoo, the individual animals would be the local scopes, while the global scopes would be the exhibits.

```
// Local Scope

function zooExhibit() {
  var zooAnimal = "Monkey";
}

// Global Scope

var zooAnimal = "Monkey";

function zooExhibit() {
  // Code here can use zooAnimal
}
```
