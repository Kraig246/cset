- After completing my first course in CSET, I would rate myself a solid 3/5. I think I did an OK job at the course, but I definitely have room for improvement.
With online learning, I find it extremely hard to pay attention without a hands-on physical connection with a traditional classroom and I have been looking for
ways to make it easier for me to pay attention. I'll also do my best to be more participant in the work and engage in my group more because based on input given to me recently,
that is something I can definitely improve upon.
- In JavaScript, an Array is a special variable that holds more than one value at once, while an Object is a standalone entity that holds its own type and properties. In the
context of WereSquirrel, 'listOfNumbers' is an array because it is written as a list of values while 'day1' or 'descriptions' is an object because they hold their own
independent types and properties. It is these aforementioned differences that explain this and make the WereSquirrel program much easier to understand.
- The author chose to make 'listOfNumbers' an array because he needed to store a sequence of values, in this case: a list of numbers. For 'day1' or 'descriptions' he chose
to make them objects because 'day1' and 'descriptions' is an individual expression because logically, you can't have two 'day1's and there is no point in having two description values
for an object because you can list all of the properties right there. Because of this, 'day1' and 'descriptions' must be objects in order to work and make sense. In my game last week,
I could have implemented objects to describe properties of the individual weapons you had to choose from, and I could have used arrays to add advanced health, hunger, and thirst mechanics in order
to make the game more immersive, realistic and difficult.
