How I'm going to organize my content

1. Universal Content:

    - Side Nav Bar (Home, Contact, Projects, Speeches)
    - Footer "Kraig O'Keefe 2020. All rights reserved."
  
2. Home:

    Header:
      - My name
      - Aspiring Software Engineer
    
    About me section:
      - Profile of myself (state education experience, work experience, personal skills, professional skills, etc.) using header elements, p elements and unordered lists.
      - Picture of myself floated to the right using CSS

3. Contact:

    Header:
      - "Like my work? Here's where you can reach out to me!"
    Body:
      - List my email, phone, LinkedIn profile and Facebook profile
      - Make an email me section (will likely be static, because the portfolio page is a static github page)
      
4.  Projects:
      
      Header:
        - "My Hard Work"
      Body:
        - Have preview images and descriptions of my projects as well as links to view them
        
5. Speeches:

      Header:
        - "A Look Into My Public Speaking Skills"
      Body:
        - Youtube links and thumbnails as well as brief descriptions of what the descriptions are about
